#### AGNOMIN
- Please start from the encoder. Please refer to the README file provided with each model for detailed instructions on usage.
- The complete dataset is not included here due to its size, but a sample dataset is available. The full dataset and its processed version will be fully published after the paper is released. For security reasons and pending clearance, we are unable to publish it on GitHub at this time.
- We have ensured that the encoder/decoder models can be accessed without any issues. The Ghidra plugin will be made available upon approval, ideally in time for review.
- We have included a supplementary PDF file to elaborate on concepts not directly pertinent to the paper or experiments that could not be included in the paper due to space constraints.
